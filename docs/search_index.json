 \n    \n  \n\n\n\n  A realtime Database for JavaScript Applications\n\n\n  RxDB (short for Reactive Database) is a NoSQL-database for JavaScript Applications like Websites, hybrid Apps, Electron-Apps, Progressive Web Apps and NodeJs.\n  Reactive means that you can not only query the current state, but subscribe to all state changes like the result of a query or even a single field of a document.\n  This is great for UI-based realtime applications in way that makes it easy to develop and also has great performance benefits. To replicate data between your clients and server, RxDB provides modules for realtime replication with any CouchDB compliant endpoint and also with custom GraphQL endpoints.\n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n  \n\n    \n   -->\n\n\n\n\n  Core features\n\n\n\n\n  Realtime Queries\n\n\n\nIn addition to normal pull-based queries, RxDB is capable of having so called realtime queries. These do not only give you the results once but instead emit the new query results each time the state of your database changes.\nThe stream comes as simple RxJS Observable and works flawless together with your frontend framework.\n\n\ndb.heroes\n  .find({\n    sort: [{name: 'asc'}]\n  })\n  .$ //  {\n    myDomElement.innerHTML = docs\n      .map(doc => '' + doc.name + '')\n      .join();\n  });\n\n\n\n  Replication\n\n\n\n  To synchronize data between your clients and your server, RxDB provides replication modules for CouchDB and GraphQL. So when your server changes data, your application will automatically stream that change to the client and updates its visual representation.\n\n\n\n\n  Multi-Window / Tab Support\n\n\n\n  When your application is opened in multiple windows or tabs at the same time, it can be tricky to synchronize actions between the open states. RxDB automatically broadcasts all changes between these tabs so you do not have to take any care of it.\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n  Other features\n\n\n\n  Schema\n\n\n\n  RxDB is based on json-schema where the structure of documents is defined for each collection. This is useful when you develop in a team with multiple developers. It also provides information for RxDB to do performance optimizations. Also the schema is versionized and you can provide migration strategies to migrate the data which is already stored on the clients.\n\n\n\n  Encryption\n\n\n\n  RxDB comes with an encryption module where specific fields of a document can be stored encrypted. So when your clients device is stolen or hacked, you can be sure that sensitive data is not readable by third parties.\n\n\n\n  Key Compression\n\n\n  Saving data on a client can be tricky because you cannot predict how much storage capacity will be available. RxDB provides a key-compression module that compresses the stored json documents which saves about 40% of storage space.\n\n\n\n\n\n    If you are new to RxDB, you should continue reading the documentation here.\n\n"},"quickstart.html":{"url":"quickstart.html","title":"Quickstart","keywords":"","body":"Quickstart\n\nInstall the RxDB library and RxJS (if not installed before)\n\nnpm install rxdb rxjs --save\n\nCreate a database with the PouchDB RxStorage (You can also use other storages based on LokiJS or Dexie.js).\n\nimport { createRxDatabase } from 'rxdb';\n\nimport { getRxStoragePouch, addPouchPlugin } from 'rxdb/plugins/pouchdb';\naddPouchPlugin(require('pouchdb-adapter-idb'));\n\nconst db = await createRxDatabase({\n  name: 'heroesdb',\n  storage: getRxStoragePouch('idb')\n});\n\n\nCreate a schema for a collection\n\nconst mySchema = {\n    title: 'human schema',\n    version: 0,\n    primaryKey: 'passportId',\n    type: 'object',\n    properties: {\n        passportId: {\n            type: 'string',\n            maxLength: 100 // \n\nAdd a collection to the database\n\nconst myCollections = await myDatabase.addCollections({\n  humans: {\n    schema: mySchema\n  },\n});\n\n\nInsert a document\n\nconst myDocument = await myDatabase.humans.insert({\n    passportId: 'foobar',\n    firstName: 'Alice',\n    lastName: 'Bobby',\n    age: 42\n});\n\n\nSubscribe to a document value\n\n\nmyDocument.lastName$.subscribe(lastName => {\n    console.log('lastName is now ' + lastName);\n});\n\n\nQuery some documents\n\nconst foundDocuments = await myDatabase.humans.find({\n    selector: {\n        age: {\n            $gt: 21\n        }\n    }\n}).exec();\n\n\nSubscribe to query results\n\nmyDatabase.humans.find({\n    selector: {\n        age: {\n            $gt: 21\n        }\n    }\n}).$.subscribe(documents => {\n    console.log('query has found ' + documents.length + ' documents');\n});\n\n\nUpdate the document\n\n// either via atomicUpdate()\nawait myDocument.atomicUpdate(data => {\n    data.lastName = 'Carol';\n    return data;\n});\n\n// or via atomicPatch()\nawait myDocument.atomicPatch({\n    lastName: 'Carol'\n});\n\n\nRemove the documentawait myDocument.remove();\n\n\n\n\nTo read the full documentation, continue here\n"},"install.html":{"url":"install.html","title":"Install","keywords":"","body":"Install\nnpm\nTo install the latest release of rxdb and its dependencies and save it to your package.json, run:\nnpm i rxdb --save\npeer-dependency\nYou also need to install the peer-dependency rxjs if you have not installed it before.\nnpm i rxjs --save\npolyfills\nRxDB is coded with es8 and transpiled to es5.

When two RxDatabases have the same name and use the same RxStorage, their data can be assumed as equal and they will share events between each other.\nDepending on the storage or adapter this can also be used to define the filesystem folder of your data.\nstorage\nRxDB works on top of an implementation of the RxStorage interface. This interface is an abstraction that allows you to use different underlaying databases that actually handle the documents. Depending on your use case you might use a different storage with different tradeoffs in performance, bundle size or supported runtimes.\nAt the moment, there are implementations for the PouchDB based storage and for the LokiJS based storage and a Dexie.js based storage.\nThese storages themself work on different adapter that determine where to store the data. For example you can use the PouchDB storage with an indexeddb adapter in the browser. Or use the LokiJS storage with the filesystem adapter in Node.js.\n\nList of PouchDB adapters\nList of LokiJS adapters\nDexie.js RxStorage\n\n\n// use the PouchDB storage with indexeddb adapter...\nimport { getRxStoragePouch, addPouchPlugin } from 'rxdb/plugins/pouchdb';\naddPouchPlugin(require('pouchdb-adapter-idb'));\n\nconst dbPouch = await createRxDatabase({\n  name: 'mydatabase',\n  storage: getRxStoragePouch('idb')\n});\n\n\n// ...or use the Dexie.js RxStorage that stores data in IndexedDB.\nimport { getRxStorageDexie } from 'rxdb/plugins/dexie';\n\nconst dbDexie = await createRxDatabase({\n  name: 'mydatabase',\n  storage: getRxStorageDexie()\n});\n\n\n// ...or use the LokiJS RxStorage with the indexeddb adapter.\nimport { getRxStorageLoki } from 'rxdb/plugins/lokijs';\nconst LokiIncrementalIndexedDBAdapter = require('lokijs/src/incremental-indexeddb-adapter');\n\nconst dbLoki = await createRxDatabase({\n  name: 'mydatabase',\n  storage: getRxStorageLoki({\n    adapter: new LokiIncrementalIndexedDBAdapter()\n  })\n});\n\npassword\n(optional)\nIf you want to use encrypted fields in the collections of a database, you have to set a password for it. The password must be a string with at least 12 characters.\nmultiInstance\n(optional=true)\nWhen you create more than one instance of the same database in a single javascript-runtime, you should set multiInstance to true. This will enable the event sharing between the two instances. For exmaple when the user has opened multiple browser windows, events will be shared between them so that both windows react to the same changes.\nmultiInstance should be set to false when you have single-instances like a single Node.js-process, a react-native-app, a cordova-app or a single-window electron app which can decrease the startup time because no instance coordination has to be done.\neventReduce\n(optional=true)\nOne big benefit of having a realtime database is that big performance optimizations can be done when the database knows a query is observed and the updated results are needed continuously.

Some RxStorages allow to use boolean fields as index.\nDepending on the field type, you must have set some meta attributes like maxLength or minimum. This is required so that RxDB\nis able to know the maximum string representation length of a field, which is needed to craft custom indexes on several RxStorage implementations.\nNOTICE: RxDB will always append the primaryKey to all indexes to ensure a deterministic sort order of query results. You do not have to add the primaryKey to any index.\nIndex-example\nconst schemaWithIndexes = {\n  version: 0,\n  title: 'human schema with indexes',\n  keyCompression: true,\n  primaryKey: 'id',\n  type: 'object',\n  properties: {\n      id: {\n          type: 'string',\n          maxLength: 100 // \nattachments\nTo use attachments in the collection, you have to add the attachments-attribute to the schema.

Therefore you can not use every schema which would be valid for the spec of json-schema.org.\nFor example, fieldnames must match the regex ^[a-zA-Z][[a-zA-Z0-9_]*]?[a-zA-Z0-9]$ and additionalProperties is always set to false.

Notice that this will not purge the document from the store but set _deleted:true like described in the pouchdb-docs in option 3.\nmyDocument.remove();\n\ndeleted$\nEmits a boolean value, depending on whether the RxDocument is deleted or not.\nlet lastState = null;\nmyDocument.deleted$.subscribe(state => lastState = state);\n\nconsole.log(lastState);\n// false\n\nawait myDocument.remove();\n\nconsole.log(lastState);\n// true\n\nget deleted\nA getter to get the current value of deleted$.\nconsole.log(myDocument.deleted);\n// false\n\nawait myDocument.remove();\n\nconsole.log(myDocument.deleted);\n// true\n\ntoJSON()\nReturns the document's data as plain json object. This will return an immutable object. To get something that can be modiefied, use toMutableJSON() instead.\nconst json = myDocument.toJSON();\nconsole.dir(json);\n/* { passportId: 'h1rg9ugdd30o',\n  firstName: 'Carolina',\n  lastName: 'Gibson',\n  age: 33 ...\n*/\n\nYou can also set withMetaFields: true to get additional meta fields like the revision, attachments or the deleted flag.\nconst json = myDocument.toJSON(true);\nconsole.dir(json);\n/* { passportId: 'h1rg9ugdd30o',\n  firstName: 'Carolina',\n  lastName: 'Gibson',\n  _deleted: false,\n  _attachments: { ... },\n  _rev: '1-aklsdjfhaklsdjhf...'\n*/\n\ntoMutableJSON()\nSame as toJSON() but returns a deep cloned object that can be mutated afterwards.\nRemember that deep cloning is performance expensive and should only be done when necessary.\nconst json = myDocument.toMutableJSON();\njson.firstName = 'Alice'; // The returned document can be mutated\n\nset()\nOnly temporary documents\nTo change data in your document, use this function. It takes the field-path and the new value as parameter. Note that calling the set-function will not change anything in your storage directly. You have to call .save() after to submit changes.\nmyDocument.set('firstName', 'foobar');\nconsole.log(myDocument.get('firstName')); // \nproxy-set\nOnly temporary documents\nAll properties of an RxDocument are assigned as setters to it so you can also directly set values instead of using the set()-function.\nmyDocument.firstName = 'foobar';\nmyDocument.whatever.nestedfield = 'foobar2';\n\nsave()\nOnly temporary documents\nThis will update the document in the storage if it has been changed. Call this after modifying the document (via set() or proxy-set).\nmyDocument.name = 'foobar';\nawait myDocument.save(); // submit the changes to the storage\n\nNOTICE: All methods of RxDocument are bound to the instance\nWhen you get a method from a RxDocument, the method is automatically bound to the documents instance.

To ensure a deterministic odering, RxDB will always append the primary key as last sort parameter to all queries and to all indexes.\nThis works in contrast to most other databases where a query without sorting would return the documents in the order in which they had been inserted to the database.\nNOTICE: RxQuery's are immutable\nBecause RxDB is a reactive database, we can do heavy performance-optimisation on query-results which change over time. To be able to do this, RxQuery's have to be immutable.\nThis means, when you have a RxQuery and run a .where() on it, the original RxQuery-Object is not changed. Instead the where-function returns a new RxQuery-Object with the changed where-field. Keep this in mind if you create RxQuery's and change them afterwards.\nExample:\nconst queryObject = myCollection.find().where('age').gt(18);\n// Creates a new RxQuery object, does not modify previous one\nqueryObject.sort('name');\nconst results = await queryObject.exec();\nconsole.dir(results); // result-documents are not sorted by name\n\nconst queryObjectSort = queryObject.sort('name');\nconst results = await queryObjectSort.exec();\nconsole.dir(results); // result-documents are now sorted\n\nisRxQuery\nReturns true if the given object is an instance of RxQuery.

Therefore you have to add an underscore suffix _ to the fieldname.\nThis works also on nested values.\nawait humansCollection.insert({\n  name: 'Alice',\n  bestFriend: 'Carol'\n});\nawait humansCollection.insert({\n  name: 'Bob',\n  bestFriend: 'Alice'\n});\nconst doc = await humansCollection.findOne('Bob').exec();\nconst bestFriend = await doc.bestFriend_; // notice the underscore_\nconsole.dir(bestFriend); //> RxDocument[Alice]\n\nExample with nested reference\nconst myCollection = await myDatabase.addCollections({\n  human: {\n    schema: {\n      version: 0,\n      type: 'object',\n      properties: {\n        name: {\n          type: 'string'\n        },\n        family: {\n          type: 'object',\n          properties: {\n            mother: {\n              type: 'string',\n              ref: 'human'\n            }\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n});\n\nconst mother = await myDocument.family.mother_;\nconsole.dir(mother); //> RxDocument\n\nExample with array\nconst myCollection = await myDatabase.addCollections({\n  human: {\n    schema: {\n      version: 0,\n      type: 'object',\n      properties: {\n        name: {\n          type: 'string'\n        },\n        friends: {\n          type: 'array',\n          ref: 'human',\n          items: {\n              type: 'string'\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  } \n});\n\n//[insert other humans here]\n\nawait myCollection.insert({\n  name: 'Alice',\n  friends: [\n    'Bob',\n    'Carol',\n    'Dave'\n  ]\n});\n\nconst doc = await humansCollection.findOne('Alice').exec();\nconst friends = await myDocument.friends_;\nconsole.dir(friends); //> Array.\n\n\nIf you are new to RxDB, you should continue here\n"},"data-migration.html":{"url":"data-migration.html","title":"DataMigration","keywords":"","body":"DataMigration\nImagine you have your awesome messenger-app distributed to many users. After a while, you decide that in your new version, you want to change the schema of the messages-collection. Instead of saving the message-date like 2017-02-12T23:03:05+00:00 you want to have the unix-timestamp like 1486940585 to make it easier to compare dates. To accomplish this, you change the schema and increase the version-number and you also change your code where you save the incoming messages. But one problem remains: what happens with the messages which are already saved on the user's device in the old schema?\nWith RxDB you can provide migrationStrategies for your collections that automatically (or on call) transform your existing data from older to newer schemas. This assures that the client's data always matches your newest code-version.\nAdd the migration plugin\nTo enable the data migration, you have to add the migration plugin.\nimport { addRxPlugin } from 'rxdb';\nimport { RxDBMigrationPlugin } from 'rxdb/plugins/migration';\naddRxPlugin(RxDBMigrationPlugin);\n\nProviding strategies\nUpon creation of a collection, you have to provide migrationStrategies when your schema's version-number is greater than 0. To do this, you have to add an object to the migrationStrategies property where a function for every schema-version is assigned. A migrationStrategy is a function which gets the old document-data as a parameter and returns the new, transformed document-data. If the strategy returns null, the document will be removed instead of migrated.\nmyDatabase.addCollections({\n  messages: {\n    schema: messageSchemaV1,\n    migrationStrategies: {\n      // 1 means, this transforms data from version 0 to version 1\n      1: function(oldDoc){\n        oldDoc.time = new Date(oldDoc.time).getTime(); // string to unix\n        return oldDoc;\n      }\n    }\n  }\n});\n\nAsynchronous strategies can also be used:\nmyDatabase.addCollections({\n  messages: {\n    schema: messageSchemaV1,\n    migrationStrategies: {\n      1: function(oldDoc){\n        oldDoc.time = new Date(oldDoc.time).getTime(); // string to unix\n        return oldDoc;\n      },\n      /**\n       * 2 means, this transforms data from version 1 to version 2\n       * this returns a promise which resolves with the new document-data\n       */\n      2: function(oldDoc){\n        // in the new schema (version: 2) we defined 'senderCountry' as required field (string)\n        // so we must get the country of the message-sender from the server\n        const coordinates = oldDoc.coordinates;\n        return fetch('http://myserver.com/api/countryByCoordinates/'+coordinates+'/')\n          .then(response => {\n            const response = response.json();\n            oldDoc.senderCountry=response;\n            return oldDoc;\n          });\n      }\n    }\n  }\n});\n\nyou can also filter which documents should be migrated:\nmyDatabase.addCollections({\n  messages: {\n    schema: messageSchemaV1,\n    migrationStrategies: {\n      // 1 means, this transforms data from version 0 to version 1\n      1: function(oldDoc){\n        oldDoc.time = new Date(oldDoc.time).getTime(); // string to unix\n        return oldDoc;\n      },\n      /**\n       * this removes all documents older then 2017-02-12\n       * they will not appear in the new collection\n       */\n      2: function(oldDoc){\n        if(oldDoc.time \nautoMigrate\nBy default, the migration automatically happens when the collection is created. If you have lots of data or the migrationStrategies take a long time, it might be better to start the migration 'by hand' and show the migration-state to the user as a loading-bar.\nconst messageCol = await myDatabase.addCollections({\n  messages: {\n    schema: messageSchemaV1,\n    autoMigrate: false, //  console.dir(state),\n  error => console.error(error),\n  done => console.log('done')\n);\n\n// the emitted states look like this:\n{\n    done: false, // true if finished\n    total: 50,   // amount of documents which must be migrated\n    handled: 0,  // amount of handled docs\n    success: 0,  // handled docs which succeeded\n    deleted: 0,  // handled docs which got deleted\n    percent: 0   // percentage\n}\n\nIf you don't want to show the state to the user, you can also use .migratePromise():\n  const migrationPromise = messageCol.migratePromise(10);\n  await migratePromise;\n\nmigrationStates()\nRxDatabase.migrationStates() returns an Observable that emits all events to the ongoing migrations of all RxCollections. Use it to log the current state of the overall migration process or to show a loading state to your user.\nconst allStatesObservable = myDatabase.migrationStates();\nallStatesObservable.subscribe(allStates => {\n  allStates.forEach(collectionState => {\n    console.log(\n      'migration state of ' +\n      collectionState.collection.name + ': ' +\n      collectionState.state.done\n    );\n  });\n});\n\nMigrating attachments\nWhen you store RxAttachments together with your document, they can also be changed, added or removed while running the migration.\nYou can do this by mutating the oldDoc._attachments property.\nimport { blobBufferUtil } from 'rxdb';\nconst migrationStrategies = {\n      1: async function(oldDoc){\n        // do nothing with _attachments to keep all attachments and have them in the new collection version.\n        return oldDoc;\n      },\n      2: async function(oldDoc){\n        // set _attachments to an empty object to delete all existing ones during the migration.\n        oldDoc._attachments = {};\n        return oldDoc;\n      }\n      3: async function(oldDoc){\n        // update the data field of a single attachment to change its data. \n        oldDoc._attachments.myFile.data = await blobBufferUtil.createBlobBuffer(\n          'my new text',\n          oldDoc._attachments.myFile.content_type\n        );\n        return oldDoc;\n      }\n}\n\nHint\nIf your migration takes a long time, combine it with the leaderElection to make sure you don't waste your users' resources by running it in 2 open tabs.\n\nIf you are new to RxDB, you should continue here\n"},"leader-election.html":{"url":"leader-election.html","title":"LeaderElection","keywords":"","body":"Leader-Election\nRxDB comes with a leader-election which elects a leading instance between different instances in the same javascript runtime.\nBefore you read this, please check out on how many of your open browser-tabs you have opened the same website more than once. Count them, I will wait..\nSo if you would now inspect the traffic that theses open tabs produce, you can see that many of them send exact the same data over wire for every tab. No matter if the data is sent with an open websocket or by polling.\nUse-case-example\nImagine we have a website which displays the current temperature of the visitors location in various charts, numbers or heatmaps. To always display the live-data, the website opens a websocket to our API-Server which sends the current temperature every 10 seconds. Using the way most sites are currently build, we can now open it in 5 browser-tabs and it will open 5 websockets which send data 6*5=30 times per minute. This will not only waste the power of your clients device, but also wastes your api-servers resources by opening redundant connections.\nSolution\nThe solution to this redundancy is the usage of a leader-election-algorithm which makes sure that always exactly one tab is managing the remote-data-access. The managing tab is the elected leader and stays leader until it is closed. No matter how many tabs are opened or closed, there must be always exactly one leader.\nYou could now start implementing a messaging-system between your browser-tabs, hand out which one is leader, solve conflicts and reassign a new leader when the old one 'dies'.\nOr just use RxDB which does all these things for you.\nAdd the leader election plugin\nTo enable the leader election, you have to add the leader-election plugin.\nimport { addRxPlugin } from 'rxdb';\nimport { RxDBLeaderElectionPlugin } from 'rxdb/plugins/leader-election';\naddRxPlugin(RxDBLeaderElectionPlugin);\n\nCode-example\nTo make it easy, here is an example where the temperature is pulled every ten seconds and saved to a collection. The pulling starts at the moment where the opened tab becomes the leader.\nconst db = await createRxDatabase({\n  name: 'weatherDB',\n  storage: getRxStoragePouch('idb'),\n  password: 'myPassword',\n  multiInstance: true\n});\nawait db.addCollections({\n  temperature: {\n    schema: mySchema\n  }\n});\n\ndb.waitForLeadership()\n  .then(() => {\n    console.log('Long lives the king!'); //  {\n      const temp = await fetch('https://example.com/api/temp/');\n      db.temperature.insert({\n          degrees: temp,\n          time: new Date().getTime()\n      });\n    }, 1000 * 10);\n  });\n\nHandle Duplicate Leaders\nOn rare occassions, it can happen that more then one leader is elected. This can happen when the CPU is on 100% or for any other reason the JavaScript process is fully blocked for a long time.\nFor most cases this is not really problem because on duplicate leaders, both browser tabs replicate with the same backend anyways.\nTo handle the duplicate leader event, you can access the leader elector and set a handler:\nimport {\n    getLeaderElectorByBroadcastChannel\n} from 'rxdb/plugins/leader-election';\n\nconst leaderElector = getLeaderElectorByBroadcastChannel(broadcastChannel);\nleaderElector.onduplicate = async () => {\n    // Duplicate leader detected -> reload the page.\n    location.reload();\n}\n\nLive-Example\nIn this example the leader is marked with the crown ♛\n\nTry it out\nRun the vanillaJS-example where the leading tab is marked with a crown on the top-right-corner.\nNotice\nThe leader election is implemented via the  broadcast-channel module.\nThe leader is elected between different processes on the same javascript-runtime. Like multiple tabs in the same browser or mupltiple NodeJs-processes on the same machine. It will not run between different replicated instances.\n\nIf you are new to RxDB, you should continue here\n"},"rx-storage.html":{"url":"rx-storage.html","title":"RxStorage","keywords":"","body":"RxStorage\nRxDB is not a self contained database.

It can do this because it is an in-memory database that processes all data in memory and only saves to disc when the app is closed or an interval is reached.\nPros\n\nQueries can run faster because all data is processed in memory.\nIt has a much faster initial load time because it loads all data from IndexedDB in a single request. But this is only true for small datasets. If much data must is stored, the initial load time can be higher then on other RxStorage implementations.\n\nCons\n\nDoes not support CouchDB replication. \nIt does not support attachments. (Make a pull request)\nData can be lost when the JavaScript process is killed ungracefully like when the browser crashes or the power of the PC is terminated.\nAll data must fit into the memory.\nSlow initialisation time when used with multiInstance: true because it has to await the leader election process.\nSlow initialisation time when really much data is stored inside of the database.\n\nUsage\nimport {\n    createRxDatabase\n} from 'rxdb';\nimport {\n    getRxStorageLoki\n} from 'rxdb/plugins/lokijs';\n\n// in the browser, we want to persist data in IndexedDB, so we use the indexeddb adapter.\nconst LokiIncrementalIndexedDBAdapter = require('lokijs/src/incremental-indexeddb-adapter');\n\nconst db = await createRxDatabase({\n    name: 'exampledb',\n    storage: getRxStorageLoki({\n        adapter: new LokiIncrementalIndexedDBAdapter(),\n        /* \n         * Do not set lokiJS persistence options like autoload and autosave,\n         * RxDB will pick proper defaults based on the given adapter\n         */\n    })\n});\n\nAdapters\nLike PouchDB, LokiJS is based on adapters that determine where to store persistend data. For LokiJS there are adapters for IndexedDB, AWS S3, the NodeJS filesystem or NativeScript.\nFind more about the possible adapters at the LokiJS docs.\nMulti-Tab support\nWhen you use plain LokiJS, you cannot build an app that can be used in multiple browser tabs. The reason is that LokiJS loads data in bulk and then only regulary persists the in-memory state to disc. When opened in multiple tabs, it would happen that the LokiJS instances overwrite each other and data is lost.\nWith the RxDB LokiJS-plugin, this problem is fixed with the LeaderElection module. Between all open tabs, a leading tab is elected and only in this tab a database is created. All other tabs do not run queries against their own database, but instead call the leading tab to send and retrieve data. When the leading tab is closed, a new leader is elected that reopens the database and processes queries. You can disable this by setting multiInstance: false when creating the RxDatabase.\nAutosave and autoload\nWhen using plain LokiJS, you could set the autosave option to true to make sure that LokiJS persists the database state after each write into the persistence adapter. Same goes to autoload which loads the persisted state on database creation.\nBut RxDB knows better when to persist the database state and when to load it, so it has its own autosave logic. This will ensure that running the persistence handler does not affect the performance of more important tasks. Instead RxDB will always wait until the database is idle and then runs the persistence handler.\nA load of the persisted state is done on database or collection creation and it is ensured that multiple load calls do not run in parallel and interfer with each other or with saveDatabase() calls.\nKnown problems\nWhen you bundle the LokiJS Plugin with webpack, you might get the error Cannot find module \"fs\". This is because LokiJS uses a require('fs') statement that cannot work in the browser.\nYou can fix that by telling webpack to not resolve the fs module with the following block in your webpack config:\n// in your webpack.config.js\n{\n    /* ... */\n    resolve: {\n        fallback: {\n            fs: false\n        }\n    }\n    /* ... */\n}\n\n// Or if you do not have a webpack.config.js like you do with angular,\n// you might fix it by setting the browser field in the package.json\n{\n  /* ... */\n  \"browser\": {\n    \"fs\": false\n  }\n  /* ... */\n}\n\nUsing the internal LokiJS database\nFor custom operations, you can access the internal LokiJS database.\nThis is dangerous because you might do changes that are not compatible with RxDB.\nOnly use this when there is no way to achieve your goals via the RxDB API.\n\nconst storageInstance = myRxCollection.storageInstance;\nconst localState = await storageInstance.internals.localState;\nlocalState.collection.insert({\n    key: 'foo',\n    value: 'bar',\n    _deleted: false,\n    _attachments: {},\n    _rev: '1-62080c42d471e3d2625e49dcca3b8e3e',\n    _meta: {\n        lwt: new Date().getTime()\n    }\n});\n\n// manually trigger the save queue because we did a write to the internal loki db. \nawait localState.databaseState.saveQueue.addWrite();\n\n\nIf you are new to RxDB, you should continue here\n"},"rx-storage-memory.html":{"url":"rx-storage-memory.html","title":"RxStorage Memory","keywords":"","body":"Memory RxStorage (beta)\nThe Memory RxStorage is based on plain in memory arrays and objects.

This ensures that when RxDB fetches 'new' changes, it can send the latest updatedAt to the GraphQL-endpoint and then recieve all newer documents.\nDeleted documents still exist but have deleted: true set. This ensures that when RxDB fetches new documents, even the deleted documents are send back and can be known at the client-side.\nRxDB documents also have an internal _deleted field that is managed by RxDB when deleting documents or pulling deleted documents from a GraphQL server.\nIf you use something like a deletedAt field instead and configure the deletedFlag option in the syncGraphQL to use the timestamp field, RxDB will still be able to keep track of deleted documents with an efficient Boolean flag.\nGraphQL Server\nAt the server-side, there must exist an endpoint which returns newer rows when the last replicated document is used as input. For example lets say you create a Query feedForRxDBReplication which returns a list of newer documents, related to the given one, sorted by updatedAt.\nFor the push-replication, you also need a modifier which lets RxDB update data with a changed document as input.\ninput HumanInput {\n    id: ID!,\n    name: String!,\n    lastName: String!,\n    updatedAt: Int!,\n    deleted: Boolean!\n}\ntype Human {\n    id: ID!,\n    name: String!,\n    lastName: String!,\n    updatedAt: Int!,\n    deleted: Boolean!\n}\ntype Query {\n    feedForRxDBReplication(lastId: String!, minUpdatedAt: Int!, limit: Int!): [Human!]!\n}\ntype Mutation {\n    # the mutations get arrays of documents as input.\n    setHumans(humans: [HumanInput]): Human # returns the last of the mutated documents\n}\n\nThe resolver would then look like:\nconst rootValue = {\n    feedForRxDBReplication: args => {\n        // sorted by updatedAt first and the id as second\n        const sortedDocuments = documents.sort((a, b) => {\n            if (a.updatedAt > b.updatedAt) return 1;\n            if (a.updatedAt  b.id) return 1;\n                if (a.id  {\n            if (doc.updatedAt  args.minUpdatedAt) return true;\n            if (doc.updatedAt === args.minUpdatedAt) {\n                // if updatedAt is equal, compare by id\n                if (doc.id > args.lastId) return true;\n                else return false;\n            }\n        });\n\n        // only return some documents in one batch\n        const limited = filterForMinUpdatedAtAndId.slice(0, args.limit);\n\n        return limited;\n    },\n    // a modifier that updates the state on the server\n    setHumans: args => {\n        const docs = args.humans;\n        let lastOne;\n        docs.forEach(doc => {\n            documents = documents.filter(d => d.id !== doc.id);\n            doc.updatedAt = Math.round(new Date().getTime() / 1000);\n            documents.push(doc);\n            lastOne = doc;\n        });\n        // returns the last of the mutated documents\n        return lastOne;\n    },\n}\n\nRxDB Client\nImport the plugin\nThe graphql-replication is not part of the default-build of RxDB. You have to import the plugin before you can use it.\nimport { RxDBReplicationGraphQLPlugin } from 'rxdb/plugins/replication-graphql';\naddRxPlugin(RxDBReplicationGraphQLPlugin);\n\nPull replication\nFor the pull-replication, you first need a pullQueryBuilder. This is a function that gets the last replicated document as input and returns an object with a GraphQL-query and its variables (or a promise that resolves to the same object). RxDB will use the query builder to construct what is later send to the GraphQL endpoint.\nconst pullQueryBuilder = doc => {\n    if (!doc) {\n        // the first pull does not have a start-document\n        doc = {\n            id: '',\n            updatedAt: 0\n        };\n    }\n    const query = `{\n        feedForRxDBReplication(lastId: \"${doc.name}\", minUpdatedAt: ${doc.updatedAt}, limit: 5) {\n            id,\n            name,\n            lastName,\n            updatedAt\n            deleted\n        }\n    }`;\n    return {\n        query,\n        variables: {}\n    };\n};\n\nWith the queryBuilder, you can then setup the pull-replication.\nconst replicationState = myCollection.syncGraphQL({\n    url: 'http://example.com/graphql', // url to the GraphQL endpoint\n    pull: {\n        queryBuilder: pullQueryBuilder, // the queryBuilder from above\n        modifier: doc => doc, // (optional) modifies all pulled documents before they are handeled by RxDB. Returning null will skip the document.\n        dataPath: undefined // (optional) specifies the object path to access the document(s). Otherwise, the first result of the response data is used.\n        /**\n         * Amount of documents that the remote will send in one request.\n         * If the response contains less then [batchSize] documents,\n         * RxDB will assume there are no more changes on the backend\n         * that are not replicated.\n         * This value is the same as the limit in the feedForRxDBReplication() schema.\n         */\n        batchSize: 5\n    },\n    deletedFlag: 'deleted', // the flag which indicates if a pulled document is deleted\n    live: true // if this is true, rxdb will watch for ongoing changes and sync them, when false, a one-time-replication will be done\n});\n\nPush replication\nFor the push-replication, you also need a queryBuilder. Here, the builder recieves a changed document as input which has to be send to the server. It also returns a GraphQL-Query and its data.\nconst pushQueryBuilder = docs => {\n    const query = `\n        mutation CreateHumans($humans: [HumanInput]) {\n            setHumans(humans: $humans) {\n                id # GraphQL does not allow returning void, so we return one id.\n            }\n        }\n    `;\n    const variables = {\n        humans: docs\n    };\n    return {\n        query,\n        variables\n    };\n};\n\nWith the queryBuilder, you can then setup the push-replication.\nconst replicationState = myCollection.syncGraphQL({\n    url: 'http://example.com/graphql', // url to the GraphQL endpoint\n    push: {\n        queryBuilder: pushQueryBuilder, // the queryBuilder from above\n        /**\n         * batchSize (optional)\n         * Amount of document that will be pushed to the server in a single request.\n         */\n        batchSize: 5,\n        /**\n         * modifier (optional)\n         * Modifies all pushed documents before they are send to the GraphQL endpoint.\n         * Returning null will skip the document.\n         */\n        modifier: doc => doc\n    },\n    deletedFlag: 'deleted', // the flag which indicates if a pulled document is deleted\n    live: true // if this is true, rxdb will watch for ongoing changes and sync them\n});\n\nOf course you can start the push- and the pull-replication in a single call to myCollection.syncGraphQL().\nUsing subscriptions\nFor the pull-replication, RxDB will run the pull-function every 10 seconds to fetch new documents from the server.\nThis means that when a change happens on the server, RxDB will, in the worst case, take 10 seconds until the changes is replicated to the client.\nTo improve this, it is recommended to setup GraphQL Subscriptions which will trigger the replication cycle when a change happens on the server.\nimport {\n    SubscriptionClient\n} from 'subscriptions-transport-ws';\n\n// start the replication\nconst replicationState = myCollection.syncGraphQL({\n    url: 'http://example.com/graphql',\n    pull: {\n        pullQueryBuilder,\n    },\n    deletedFlag: 'deleted', // the flag which indicates if a pulled document is deleted\n    live: true,\n    /**\n     * Because we use the subscriptions as notifiers,\n     * we can set the liveInterval to a very height value.\n     */\n    liveInterval: 60 * 1000\n});\n\n\n// setup the subscription client\nconst wsClient = new SubscriptionClient(\n    'ws://example.com/subscriptions', {\n        reconnect: true,\n    }\n);\n\nconst query = `subscription onHumanChanged {\n    humanChanged {\n        id\n    }\n}`;\nconst changeObservable = wsClient.request({ query });\n// subscribe to all events\nchangeObservable.subscribe({\n    next(data) {\n        /**\n         * When a change happens, call .run() on the replicationState.\n         * This will trigger the pull-handler and download changes from the server.\n         */\n        replicationState.run();\n    }\n});\n\nHelper Functions\nRxDB provides the helper functions graphQLSchemaFromRxSchema(), pullQueryBuilderFromRxSchema() and pushQueryBuilderFromRxSchema() that can be used to generate the GraphQL Schema from the RxJsonSchema. To learn how to use them, please inspect the GraphQL Example.\nConflict Resolution\nRxDB assumes that the Conflict Resolution will happen on the server side.\nWhen the clients sends a document to the server which causes a conflict, this has to be resolved there and then the resulting document can be synced down to RxDB. While CouchDB uses revision-flags for conflicts, you can use any logic like relying on the updatedAt date or other flags.\nRxGraphQLReplicationState\nWhen you call myCollection.syncGraphQL() it returns a RxGraphQLReplicationState which can be used to subscribe to events, for debugging or other functions.\n.isStopped()\nReturns true if the replication is stopped. This can be if a non-live replication is finished or a replication got canceled.\nreplicationState.isStopped(); // true/false\n\n.setHeaders()\nChanges the headers for the replication after it has been set up.\nreplicationState.setHeaders({\n    Authorization: `...`\n});\n\n.awaitInitialReplication()\nReturns a Promise that is resolved as soon as the initial replication is done.\nawait replicationState.awaitInitialReplication();\nconsole.log('initial sync done, client data is equal to server data');\n\n.run()\nTriggers a replication cycle with the server. This is done automatically if the data changes on the client side or the pull-interval is called. This returns a Promise which is resolved when the run-cycle is done. Calling run() many times is no problem because it is queued internally.\nawait replicationState.run();\n\n.cancel()\nCancels the replication. This is done autmatically if the RxCollection or it's RxDatabase is destroyed.\nawait replicationState.cancel();\n\n.received$\nAn Observable that emits each document that is received from the endpoint.\n.send$\nAn Observable that emits each document that is send to the endpoint.\n.error$\nAn Observable that emits each error that happens during the replication. Use this if something does not work for debugging. RxDB will handle network errors automatically, other errors must be solved by the developer.\nreplicationState.error$.subscribe(error => {\n    console.log('something was wrong');\n    console.dir(error);\n});\n\nGraphQL errors are wrapped in a RxReplicationError, which has a payload property with information to help you handle the underlying error.\nThe payload has a type field with a value of \"pull\" or \"push\", corresponding to an error in either a GraphQL pull or push replication operation, respectively.\nIf the error occurs doing a push, the payload also contains a documentData property, which corresponds to the document data supplied to the push query builder.\nNotice: You may see errors in this observable that are not RxReplicationError.\nReplication may fail for reasons unrelated to the GraphQL service.\nE.g., your PouchDB or LokiJS database may have issues in which case a general error will be generated and passed on.\nAs an example, you can try to recover from errors like so:\nreplicationState.error$.subscribe((error) => {\n    if (error.type === 'pull') {\n        console.log('error pulling from GraphQL server', error.innerErrors);\n    } else if (error.type === 'push') {\n        if (error.innerErrors && error.innerErrors.length > 0) {\n            const graphQLError = error.innerErrors[0];\n\n            // In this hypothetical case, there's a remote database uniqueness constraint being violated due to two\n            // clients pushing an object with the same property value. With the document data, you can decide how best\n            // to resolve the issue. In this case, the client that pushed last \"loses\" and we delete the object since\n            // the one it conflicts with will be pulled down during the next pull replication event.\n            // The `graphQLError` structure is dictated by your remote GraphQL service. The field names are likely\n            // to be different.\n            if (graphQLError.code === 'constraint-violation' && graphQLError.constraintName === \"unique_profile_name\") {\n                this.db.profiles\n                    .findOne(documentData.id)\n                    .exec()\n                    .then((doc) => {\n                        doc?.remove();\n                    });\n            }\n        } else {\n            console.log('error pushing document to GraphQL server', documentData);\n        }\n    } else {\n        // General error occurred. E.g., issue communicating with local database.\n        console.log('something was wrong');\n        console.dir(error);\n    }\n});\n\n.canceled$\nAn Observable that emits true when the replication is canceled, false if not.\n.active$\nAn Observable that emits true when the replication is doing something, false when not.\nNOTICE: To play around, check out the full example of the RxDB GraphQL replication with server and client\n\nIf you are new to RxDB, you should continue here\n"},"replication.html":{"url":"replication.html","title":"Replication Primitives","keywords":"","body":"Replication primitives\nWith the replication primitives plugin, you can build a realtime replication based on a transport layer like REST, WebRTC or websockets or any other transport layer. Also the GraphQL replication plugin is build on top of the replication primitives.\nTrade offs\n\nThis plugin is made to do a many-to-one replication like you would do when you replicate many clients with one backend server. It is not possible to replicate things in a star schema like it can be done with the couchdb replication.\n\nThis plugin is made for fast and reliable replication, it has less overhead then the couchdb replication for example.\n\nIt is assumes that the remote instance is the single source of truth that also resolves conflicts.\n\nThe replication of attachments or local documents is not supported at the moment.\n\n\nData Layout\nTo use the replication primitives you first have to ensure that:\n\ndocuments are deterministic sortable by their last write time\ndeterministic means that even if two documents have the same last write time, they have a predictable sort order.\n  This is most often ensure by using the primaryKey as second sort parameter.\n\ndocuments are never deleted, instead the _deleted field is set to true.\nThis is needed so that the deletion state of a document exists in the database and can be replicated with other instances.\n\n\nFor example if your documents look like this:\n{\n    \"id\": \"foobar\",\n    \"name\": \"Alice\",\n    \"lastName\": \"Wilson\",\n    /**\n     * Contains the last write timestamp\n     * so all documents writes can be sorted by that value\n     * when they are fetched from the remote instance.\n     */\n    \"updatedAt\": 1564483474,\n    /**\n     * Instead of physically deleting documents,\n     * a deleted document gets replicated.\n     */\n    \"_deleted\": false\n}\n\nThen your data is always sortable by updatedAt. This ensures that when RxDB fetches 'new' changes, it can send the latest updatedAt to the remote endpoint and then recieve all newer documents.\nThe deleted field must always be exactly _deleted. If your remote endpoint uses a different field to mark deleted documents, you have to map the fields in the pull- and push handlers.\nThe replication cycle\nThe replication works in cycles. A cycle is triggered when:\n\nAutomatically on writes to non-local documents.\nWhen liveInterval is reached from the time of last run() cycle.\nThe run() method is called manually.\n\nA cycle performs these steps in the given order:\n\nGet a batch of unreplicated document writes and call the push handler with them to send them to the remote instance.\nRepeat step 1 until there are no more local unreplicated changes.\nGet the latestPullDocument from the local database.\nCall the pull handler with latestPullDocument to fetch a batch from remote unreplicated document writes.\nWhen the pull handler has returned the remote documents...\n...if a local write happened in between, drop the pulled changes and start from step 1 to not miss out local writes.\n...if no local write happend in between, persist the pulled changes to the local state.\n\n\nUpdate latestPullDocument with the newest latest document from the remote.\nRepeat step 3+4+5 until the pull handler returns hasMoreDocuments: false.\n\nError handling\nWhen sending a document to the remote fails for any reason, RxDB will send it again in a later point in time.\nThis happens for all errors. The document write could have already reached the remote instance and be processed, while only the answering fails.\nThe remote instance must be designed to handle this properly and to not crash on duplicate data transmissions. \nDepending on your use case, it might be ok to just write the duplicate document data again.\nBut for a more resilent error handling you could compare the last write timestamps or add a unique write id field to the document. This field can then be used to detect duplicates and ignore re-send data.\nConflict resolution\nImagine two of your users modify the same JSON document, while both are offline. After they go online again, their clients replicate the modified document to the server. Now you have two conflicting versions of the same document, and you need a way to determine how the correct new version of that document should look like. This process is called conflict resolution.\nRxDB relies solely on the remote instance to detect and resolve conflicts. Each document write is sent to the remote where conflicts can be resolved and the winning document can be sent back to the clients on the next run of the pull handler.\nSecurity\nBe aware that client side clocks can never be trusted. When you have a client-backend replication, the backend should overwrite the updatedAt timestamp when it receives the change from the client.\nreplicateRxCollection()\nYou can start the replication of a single RxCollection by calling replicateRxCollection() like in the following:\nimport { replicateRxCollection } from 'rxdb/plugins/replication';\nconst replicationState = await replicateRxCollection({\n    collection: myRxCollection,\n    /**\n     * An id for the replication to identify it\n     * and so that RxDB is able to resume the replication on app reload.\n     * If you replicate with a remote server, it is recommended to put the\n     * server url into the replicationIdentifier.\n     */\n    replicationIdentifier: 'my-rest-replication-to-https://example.com/rest',\n    /**\n     * By default it will do a one-time replication.\n     * By settings live: true the replication will continuously\n     * replicate all changes.\n     * (optional), default is false.\n     */\n    live: true,\n    /**\n     * Interval in milliseconds on when to run the next replication cycle.\n     * Set this to 0 when you have a back-channel from your remote\n     * that that tells the client when to fetch remote changes.\n     * (optional), only needed when live=true, default is 10 seconds.\n     */\n    liveInterval: 10000,\n    /**\n     * Time in milliseconds after when a failed replication cycle\n     * has to be retried.\n     * (optional), default is 5 seconds.\n     */\n    retryTime: number,\n    /**\n     * Optional,\n     * only needed when you want to replicate remote changes to the local state.\n     */\n    pull: {\n        /**\n         * Pull handler\n         */\n        async handler(latestPullDocument) {\n            const limitPerPull = 10;\n            const minTimestamp = latestPullDocument ?

This makes sense especially when RxDB is used in UI-applications where people move for- and backwards on different routes or pages and the same queries are used many times. Because of the event-reduce algorithm cached queries are even valuable for optimization, when changes to the database occur between now and the last execution.\nCache Replacement Policy\nTo not let RxDB fill up all the memory, a cache replacement policy is defined that clears up the cached queries. This is implemented as a function which runs regularly, depending on when queries are created and the database is idle. The default policy should be good enough for most use cases but defining custom ones can also make sense.\nThe default policy\nThe default policy starts cleaning up queries depending on how much queries are in the cache and how much document data they contain.\n\nIt will never uncache queries that have subscribers to their results\nIt tries to always have less then 100 queries without subscriptions in the cache.\nIt prefers to uncache queries that have never executed and are older then 30 seconds\nIt prefers to uncache queries that have not been used for longer time\n\nOther references to queries\nWith JavaScript, it is not possible to count references to variables. Therefore it might happen that an uncached RxQuery is still referenced by the users code and used to get results. This should never be a problem, uncached queries must still work. Creating the same query again however, will result in having two RxQuery instances instead of one.\nUsing a custom policy\nA cache replacement policy is a normal JavaScript function according to the type RxCacheReplacementPolicy.\nIt gets the RxCollection as first parameter and the QueryCache as second. Then it itterates over the cached RxQuery instances and uncaches the desired ones with uncacheRxQuery(rxQuery).

This makes the local database, not the server, the gateway for all persistent changes in application state.\n\nOffline first is not about having no internet connection\n\nWhile in the past, internet connection was an unstable, things are changing especially for mobile devices.\nMobile networks become better and having no internet becomes less common even in remote locations.\nSo if we did not care about offline first applications in the past, why should we even care now?\nIn the following I will point out why offline first applications are better, not because they support offline usage, but because of other reasons.\nUX is better without loading spinners\nIn 'normal' web applications, most user interactions like fetching, saving or deleting data, correspond to a request to the backend server. This means that each of these interactions require the user to await the unknown latency to and from a remote server while looking at a loading spinner.\nIn offline-first apps, the operations go directly against the local storage which happens almost instantly. There is no perceptible loading time and so it is not even necessary to implement a loading spinner at all. As soon as the user clicks, the UI represents the new state as if it was already changed in the backend.\n\n  \n\n\nMulti-tab usage just works\nMany, even big websites like amazon, reddit and stack overflow do not handle multi tab usage correctly. When a user has multiple tabs of the website open and does a login on one of these tabs, the state does not change on the other tabs.\nOn offline first applications, there is always exactly one state of the data across all tabs. Offline first databases (like RxDB) store the data inside of IndexedDb and share the state between all tabs of the same origin.\n\n  \n\n\nLatency is more important than bandwidth\nIn the past, often the bandwidth was the limiting factor on determining the loading time of an application.\nBut while bandwidth has improved over the years, latency became the limiting factor.\nYou can always increase the bandwidth by setting up more cables or sending more Starlink satellites to space.\nBut reducing the latency is not so easy. It is defined by the physical properties of the transfer medium, the speed of light and the distance to the server. All of these three are hard to optimize.\nOffline first application benefit from that because sending the initial state to the client can be done much faster with more bandwidth. And once the data is there, we do no longer have to care about the latency to the backend server.\n\n  \n\n\n\nRealtime comes for free\nMost websites lie to their users. They do not lie because they display wrong data, but because they display old data that was loaded from the backend at the time the user opened the site.\nTo overcome this, you could build a realtime website where you create a websocket that streams updates from the backend to the client. This means work. Your client needs to tell the server which page is currently opened and which updates the client is interested to. Then the server can push updates over the websocket and you can update the UI accordingly.\nWith offline first applications, you already have a realtime replication with the backend. Most offline first databases provide some concept of changestream or data subscriptions and with RxDB you can even directly subscribe to query results or single fields of documents. This makes it easy to have an always updated UI whenever data on the backend changes.\n\n  \n\n\n\nScales with data size, not with the amount of user interaction\nOn normal applications, each user interaction can result in multiple requests to the backend server which increase its load.\nThe more users interact with your application, the more backend resources you have to provide.\nOffline first applications do not scale up with the amount of user actions but instead they scale up with the amount of data.\nOnce that data is transferred to the client, the user can do as many interactions with it as required without connecting to the server.\nModern apps have longer runtimes\nIn the past you used websites only for a short time. You open it, perform some action and then close it again. This made the first load time the important metric when evaluating page speed.\nToday web applications have changed and with it the way we use them. Single page applications are opened once and then used over the whole day. Chat apps, email clients, PWAs and hybrid apps. All of these were made to have long runtimes.\nThis makes the time for user interactions more important than the initial loading time. Offline first applications benefit from that because there is often no loading time on user actions while loading the initial state to the client is not that relevant.\nYou might not need REST\nOn normal web applications, you make different requests for each kind of data interaction.\nFor that you have to define a swagger route, implement a route handler on the backend and create some client code to send or fetch data from that route. The more complex your application becomes, the more REST routes you have to maintain and implement.\nWith offline first apps, you have a way to hack around all this cumbersome work. You just replicate the whole state from the server to the client. The replication does not only run once, you have a realtime replication and all changes at one side are automatically there on the other side. On the client, you can access every piece of state with a simple database query.\nWhile this of course only works for amounts of data that the client can load and store, it makes implementing prototypes and simple apps much faster.\nYou might not need Redux\nData is hard, especially for UI applications where many things can happen at the same time.\nThe user is clicking around. Stuff is loaded from the server. All of these things interact with the global state of the app.\nTo manage this complexity it is common to use state management libraries like Redux or MobX. With them, you write all this lasagna code to wrap the mutation of data and to make the UI react to all these changes.\nOn offline first apps, your global state is already there in a single place stored inside of the local database.\nYou do not have to care whether this data came from the UI, another tab, the backend or another device of the same user. You can just make writes to the database and fetch data out of it.\n\n\nIf you are new to RxDB, you should continue with the Downsides of Offline First\n"},"downsides-of-offline-first.html":{"url":"downsides-of-offline-first.html","title":"Downsides of Offline First","keywords":"","body":"Downsides of Offline First\nSo you have read all theses things about how the offline first paradigm makes it easy to create realtime web applications that even work when the user has no internet connection.\nBut there is no free lunch. The offline first paradigm is not the perfect approach for all kinds of apps.\n\nYou fully understood a technology when you know when not to use it\n\nIn the following I will point out the limitations you need to know before you decide to use RxDB or even before you decide to create an offline first application.\nIt only works with small datasets\nMaking data available offline means it must be loaded from the server and then stored at the clients device.\nYou need to load the full dataset on the first pageload and on every ongoing load you need to download the new changes to that set.\nWhile in theory you could download in infinite amount of data, in practice you have a limit how long the user can wait before having an up-to-date state.\nYou want to display chat messages like Whatsapp? No problem. Syncing all the messages a user could write, can be done with a few HTTP requests.\nWant to make a tool that displays server logs? Good luck downloading terabytes of data to the client just to search for a single string. This will not work.\nBesides the network usage, there is another limit for the size of your data.\nIn browsers you have some options for storage: Cookies, Localstorage, WebSQL and IndexedDB.\nBecause Cookies and Localstorage is slow and WebSQL is deprecated, you will use IndexedDB.\nThe limit of how much data you can store in IndexedDB depends on two factors: Which browser is used and how much disc space is left on the device. You can assume that at least a couple of hundred megabytes are available at least. The maximum is potentially hundreds of gigabytes or more, but the browser implementations vary. Chrome allows the browser to use up to 60% of the total disc space per origin. Firefox allows up to 50%. But on safari you can only store up to 1GB and the browser will prompt the user on each additional 200MB increment.\nThe problem is, that you have no chance to really predict how much data can be stored. So you have to make assumptions that are hopefully true for all of your users. Also, you have no way to increase that space like you would add another hard drive to your backend server. Once your clients reach the limit, you likely have to rewrite big parts of your applications.\nBrowser storage is not really persistent\nWhen data is stored inside IndexedDB or one of the other storage APIs, it cannot be trusted to stay there forever.\nApple for example deletes the data when the website was not used in the last 7 days. The other browsers also have logic to clean up the stored data, and in the end the user itself could be the one that deletes the browers local data.\nThe most common way to handle this, is to replicate everything from the backend to the client again.\nOf course, this does not work for state that is not stored at the backend. So if you assume you can store the users private data inside the browser in a secure way, you are wrong.\n\n  \n\n\nThere can be conflicts\nImagine two of your users modify the same JSON document, while both are offline. After they go online again, their clients replicate the modified document to the server. Now you have two conflicting versions of the same document, and you need a way to determine how the correct new version of that document should look like. This process is called conflict resolution.\n\nThe default in many offline first databases is a deterministic conflict resolution strategy. Both conflicting versions of the document are kept in the storage and when you query for the document, a winner is determined by comparing the hashes of the document and only the winning document is returned. Because the comparison is deterministic, all clients and servers will always pick the same winner. This kind of resolution only works when it is not that important that one of the document changes gets dropped. Because conflicts are rare, this might be a viable solution for some use cases.\n\nA better resolution can be applied by listening to the changestream of the database. The changestream emits an event each time a write happens to the database. The event contains information about the written document and also a flag if there is a conflicting version. For each event with a conflict, you fetch all versions for that document and create a new document that contains the winning state. With that you can implement pretty complex conflict resolution strategies, but you have to manually code it for each collection of documents.\n\nInstead of the solving conflict once at every client, it can be made a bit easier by solely relying on the backend. This can be done when all of your clients replicate with the same single backend server. With RxDB's Graphql Replication each client side change is sent to the server where conflicts can be resolved and the winning document can be sent back to the clients.\n\nSometimes there is no way to solve a conflict with code. If your users edit text based documents or images, often only the user's themself can decide how the winning revision has to look. For these cases, you have to implement complex UI parts where the users can inspect the conflict and manage its resolution.\n\nYou do not have to handle conflicts if they cannot happen in the first place. You can achieve that by designing a write only database where existing documents cannot be touched. Instead of storing the current state in a single document, you store all the events that lead to the current state. Sometimes called the \"everything is a delta\" strategy, others would call it Event Sourcing. Like an accountant that does not need an eraser, you append all changes and afterwards aggregate the current state at the client.\n// create one new document for each change to the users balance\n{id: new Date().toJSON(), change: 100} // balance increased by $100\n{id: new Date().toJSON(), change: -50} // balance decreased by $50\n{id: new Date().toJSON(), change: 200} // balance increased by $200\n\n\nThere is this thing called conflict-free replicated data type, short CRDT. Using a CRDT library like automerge will magically solve all of your conflict problems. Until you use it in production where you observe that implementing CRDTs has basically the same complexity as implementing conflict resolution strategies.\n\n\nRealtime is a lie\nSo you replicate stuff between the clients and your backend. Each change on one side directly changes the state of the other sides in realtime. But this \"realtime\" is not the same as in realtime computing. In the offline first world, the word realtime was introduced by firebase and is more meant as a marketing slogan than a technical description.\nThere is an internet between your backend and your clients and everything you do on one machine takes at least once the latency until it can affect anything on the other machines. You have to keep this in mind when you develop anything where the timing is important, like a multiplayer game or a stock trading app.\nEven when you run a query against the local database, there is no \"real\" realtime.\nClient side databases run on JavaScript and JavaScript runs on a single CPU that might be partially blocked because the user is running some background processes. So you can never guarantee a response deadline which violates the time constraint of realtime computing.\n\n  \n\n\nEventual consistency\nAn offline first app does not have a single source of truth. There is a source on the backend, one on the own client, and also each other client has its own definition of truth. At the moment your user starts the app, the local state is hopefully already replicated with the backend and all other clients. But this does not have to be true, the states can have converged and you have to plan for that.\nThe user could update a document based on wrong assumptions because it was not fully replicated at that point in time because the user is offline. A good way to handle this problem is to show the replication state in the UI and tell the user when the replication is running, stopped, paused or finished.\nAnd some data is just too important to be \"eventual consistent\". Create a wire transfer in your online banking app while you are offline. You keep the smartphone laying at your night desk and when you use again in the next morning, it goes online and replicates the transaction. No thank you, do not use offline first for these kind of things, or at least you have to display the replication state of each document in the UI.\n\n  \n\n\n\nPermissions and authentication\nEvery offline first app that goes beyond a prototype, does likely not have the same global state for all of its users. Each user has a different set of documents that are allowed to be replicated or seen by the user. So you need some kind of authentication and permission handling to divide the documents.\nThe easy way is to just create one database for each user on the backend and only allow to replicate that one. Creating that many databases is not really a problem with for example CouchDB, and it makes permission handling easy.\nBut as soon as you want to query all of your data in the backend, it will bite back. Your data is not at a single place, it is distributed between all of the user specific databases. This becomes even more complex as soon as you store information together with the documents that is not allowed to be seen by outsiders. You not only have to decide which documents to replicate, but also which fields of them.\nSo what you really want is a single datastore in the backend and then replicate only the allowed document parts to each of the users.\nThis always requires you to implement your custom replication endpoint like what you do with RxDBs GraphQL Replication.\nYou have to migrate the client database\nWhile developing your app, sooner or later you want to change the data layout. You want to add some new fields to documents or change the format of them. So you have to update the database schema and also migrate the stored documents.\nWith 'normal' applications, this is already hard enough and often dangerous. You wait until midnight, stop the webserver, make a database backup, deploy the new schema and then you hope that nothing goes wrong while it updates that many documents.\nWith offline first applications, it is even more fun. You do not only have to migrate your local backend database, you also have to provide a migration strategy for all of these client databases out there. And you also cannot migrate everything at the same time. The clients can only migrate when the new code was updated from the appstore or the user visited your website again. This could be today or in a few weeks.\nPerformance is not native\nWhen you create a web based offline first app, you cannot store data directly on the users filesystem. In fact there are many layers between your JavaScript code and the filesystem of the operation system. Let's say you insert a document in RxDB:\n\nYou call the RxDB API to validate and store the data\nRxDB calls the underlying RxStorage, for example PouchDB.\nPouchdb calls its underlying storage adapter\nThe storage adapter calls IndexedDB\nThe browser runs its internal handling of the IndexedDB API\nIn most browsers IndexedDB is implemented on top of SQLite\nSQLite calls the OS to store the data in the filesystem\n\nAll these layers are abstractions. They are not build for exactly that one use case, so you lose some performance to tunnel the data through the layer itself, and you also lose some performance because the abstraction does not exactly provide the functions that are needed by the layer above and it will overfetch data.\nYou will not find a benchmark comparison between how many transactions per second you can run on the browser compared to a server based database. Because it makes no sense to compare them. Browsers are slower, JavaScript is slower.\n\nIs it fast enough?\n\nWhat you really care about is \"Is it fast enough?\". For most use cases, the answer is yes. Offline first apps are UI based and you do not need to process a million transactions per second, because your user will not click the save button that often. \"Fast enough\" means that the data is processed in under 16 milliseconds so that you can render the updated UI in the next frame. This is of course not true for all use cases, so you better think about the performance limit before starting with the implementation.\nNothing is predictable\nYou have a PostgreSQL database and run a query over 1000ths of rows, which takes 200 milliseconds. Works great, so you now want to do something similar at the client device in your offline first app. How long does it take? You cannot know because people have different devices, and even equal devices have different things running in the background that slow the CPUs. So you cannot predict performance and as described above, you cannot even predict the storage limit. So if your app does heavy data analytics, you might better run everything on the backend and just send the results to the client.\nThere is no relational data\nI started creating RxDB many years ago and while still maintaining it, I often worked with all these other offline first databases out there. RxDB and all of these other ones, are based on some kind of document databases similar to NoSQL. Often people want to have a relational database like the SQL one they use at the backend. \nSo why are there no real relations in offline first databases? I could answer with these arguments like how JavaScript works better with document based data, how performance is better when having no joins or even how NoSQL queries are more composable. But the truth is, everything is NoSQL because it makes replication easy. An SQL query that mutates data in different tables based on some selects and joins, cannot be partially replicated without breaking the client. You have foreign keys that point to other rows and if these rows are not replicated yet, you have a problem. To implement a robust replication protocol for relational data, you need some stuff like a reliable atomic clock and you have to block queries over multiple tables while a transaction replicated. Watch this guy implementing offline first replication on top of SQLite or read this discussion about implementing offline first in supabase.\nSo creating replication for an SQL offline first database is way more work then just adding some network protocols on top of PostgreSQL. It might not even be possible for clients that have no reliable clock.\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are new to RxDB, you should continue with Why it has to be NoSQL\n"},"slow-indexeddb.html":{"url":"slow-indexeddb.html","title":"Slow IndexedDB","keywords":"","body":"Why IndexedDB is slow and what to use instead\nSo you have a JavaScript web application that needs to store data at the client side, either to make it offline useable, just for caching purposes or for other reasons.\nFor in-browser data storage, you have some options:\n\nCookies are send which each HTTP request, so you cannot store more then a few strings in them.\nWebSQL is deprecated because it never was a real standard and turning it into a standard would have been too difficult.\nLocalStorage is a synchronous API over asynchronous IO-access. Storing and reading data can fully block the JavaScript process so you cannot use LocalStorage for more then few simple key-value pairs.\nThe FileSystem API could be used to store plain binary files, but it is only supported in chrome for now.\nIndexedDB is an indexed key-object database. It can store json data and iterate over its indexes. It is widely supported and stable.\n\nIt becomes clear that the only way to go is IndexedDB. You start developing your app and everything goes fine.\nBut as soon as your app gets bigger, more complex or just handles more data, you might notice something. IndexedDB is slow. Not slow like a database on a cheap server, even slower! Inserting a few hundred documents can take up several seconds. Time which can be critical for a fast page load. Even sending data over the internet to the backend can be faster then storing it inside of an IndexedDB database.\n\nTransactions vs Throughput\n\nSo before we start complaining, lets analyze what exactly is slow. When you run tests on Nolans Browser Database Comparison you can see that inserting 1k documents into IndexedDB takes about 80 milliseconds, 0.08ms per document. This is not really slow. It is quite fast and it is very unlikely that you want to store that many document at the same time at the client side. But the key point here is that all these documents get written in a single transaction.\nI forked the comparison tool here and changed it to use one transaction per document write. And there we have it. Inserting 1k documents with one transaction per write, takes about 2 seconds. Interestingly if we increase the document size to be 100x bigger, it still takes about the same time to store them. This makes clear that the limiting factor to IndexedDB performance is the transaction handling, not the data throughput.\n\n  \n\n\nTo fix your IndexedDB performance problems you have to make sure to use as less data transfers/transactions as possible.\nSometimes this is easy, as instead of iterating over a documents list and calling single inserts, with RxDB you could use the bulk methods to store many document at once.\nBut most of the time is not so easy. Your user clicks around, data gets replicated from the backend, another browser tab writes data. All these things can happen at random time and you cannot crunch all that data in a single transaction.\nAnother solution is to just not care about performance at all. In a few releases the browser vendors will have optimized IndexedDB and everything is fast again. Well, IndexedDB was slow in 2013 and it is still slow today. If this trend continues, it will still be slow in a few years from now. Waiting is not an option. The chromium devs made a statement to focus on optimizing read performance, not write performance.\nSwitching to WebSQL (even if it is deprecated) is also not an option because, like the comparsion tool shows, it has even slower transactions.\nSo you need a way to make IndexedDB faster. In the following I lay out some performance optimizations than can be made to have faster reads and writes in IndexedDB.\nHINT: You can reproduce all performance tests in this repo. In all tests we work on a dataset of 40000 human documents with a random age between 1 and 100.\nBatched Cursor\nWith IndexedDB 2.0, new methods where introduced which can be utilized to improve performance. With the getAll() method, a faster alternative to the old openCursor() can be created which improves performance when reading data from the IndexedDB store.\nLets say we want to query all user documents that have an age greater then 25 out of the store.\nTo implement a fast batched cursor that only needs calls to getAll() and not to getAllKeys(), we first need to create an age index that contains the primary id as last field.\nmyIndexedDBObjectStore.createIndex(\n    'age-index',\n    [\n        'age',\n        'id'\n    ]\n);\n\nThis is required because the age field is not unique, and we need a way to checkpoint the last returned batch so we can continue from there in the next call to getAll().\nconst maxAge = 25;\nlet result = [];\nconst tx: IDBTransaction = db.transaction([storeName], 'readonly', TRANSACTION_SETTINGS);\nconst store = tx.objectStore(storeName);\nconst index = store.index('age-index');\nlet lastDoc;\nlet done = false;\n/**\n * Run the batched cursor until all results are retrieved\n * or the end of the index is reached.\n */\nwhile (done === false) {\n    await new Promise((res, rej) => {\n        const range = IDBKeyRange.bound(\n          /**\n           * If we have a previous document as checkpoint,\n           * we have to continue from it's age and id values.\n           */\n            [\n                lastDoc ? lastDoc.age : -Infinity,\n                lastDoc ? lastDoc.id : -Infinity,\n            ],\n            [\n                maxAge + 0.00000001,\n                String.fromCharCode(65535)\n            ],\n            true,\n            false\n        );\n        const openCursorRequest = index.getAll(range, batchSize);\n        openCursorRequest.onerror = err => rej(err);\n        openCursorRequest.onsuccess = e => {\n            const subResult: TestDocument[] = e.target.result;\n            lastDoc = lastOfArray(subResult);\n            if (subResult.length === 0) {\n                done = true;\n            } else {\n                result = result.concat(subResult);\n            }\n            res();\n        };\n    });\n}\nconsole.dir(result);\n\n\n  \n\n\nAs the performance test results show, using a batched cursor can give a huge improvement. Intererstingly the choosing a hight batch size is important. When you known that all results of a given IDBKeyRange are needed, you should not set a batch size at all and just directly query all documents via getAll().\nRxDB uses batched cursors in the IndexedDB RxStorage.\nIndexedDB Sharding\nSharding is a technique, normally used in server side databases, where the database is partitioned horizontally. Instead of storing all documents at one table/collection, the documents are split into so called shards and each shard is stored on one table/collection. This is done in server side architectures to spread the load between multiple physical servers which increases scalability.\nWhen you use IndexedDB in a browser, there is of course no way to split the load between the client and other servers. But you can still benefit from sharding. Partitioning the documents horizontally into multiple IndexedDB stores, has shown to have a big performance improvement in write- and read operations while only increasing inital pageload slightly.\n\n  \n\n\nAs shown in the performance test results, sharding should always be done by IDBObjectStore and not by database. Running a batched cursor over the whole dataset with 10 store shards in parallel is about 28% faster then running it over a single store. Initialization time increases minimal from 9 to 17 milliseconds.\nGetting a quarter of the dataset by batched iterating over an index, is even 43% faster with sharding then when a single store is queried.\nAs downside, getting 10k documents by their id is slower when it has to run over the shards.\nAlso it can be much effort to recombined the results from the different shards into the required query result. When a query without a limit is done, the sharding method might cause a data load huge overhead.\nSharding can be used with RxDB with the Sharding Plugin.\nCustom Indexes\nIndexes improve the query performance of IndexedDB significant. Instead of fetching all data from the storage when you search for a subset of it, you can iterate over the index and stop iterating when all relevant data has been found.\nFor example to query for all user documents that have an age greater then 25, you would create an age+id index.\nTo be able to run a batched cursor over the index, we always need our primary key (id) as the last index field.\nInstead of doing this, you can use a custom index which can improve the performance. The custom index runs over a helper field ageIdCustomIndex which is added to each document on write. Our index now only contains a single string field instead of two (age-number and id-string).\n// On document insert add the ageIdCustomIndex field.\nconst idMaxLength = 20; // must be known to craft a custom index  \ndocData.ageIdCustomIndex = docData.age + docData.id.padStart(idMaxLength, ' ');\nstore.put(docData);\n// ...\n\n// normal index\nmyIndexedDBObjectStore.createIndex(\n    'age-index',\n    [\n        'age',\n        'id'\n    ]\n);\n\n// custom index\nmyIndexedDBObjectStore.createIndex(\n    'age-index-custom',\n    [\n        'ageIdCustomIndex'\n    ]\n);\n\nTo iterate over the index, you also use a custom crafted keyrange, depending on the last batched cursor checkpoint. Therefore the maxLength of id must be known.\n// keyrange for normal index\nconst range = IDBKeyRange.bound(\n    [25, ''],\n    [Infinity, Infinity],\n    true,\n    false\n);\n\n// keyrange for custom index\nconst range = IDBKeyRange.bound(\n    // combine both values to a single string\n    25 + ''.padStart(idMaxLength, ' '),\n    Infinity,\n    true,\n    false\n);\n\n\n  \n\n\nAs shown, using a custom index can further improve the performance of running a batched cursor by about 10%.\nAnother big benefit of using custom indexes, is that you can also encode boolean values in them, which cannot be done with normal IndexedDB indexes.\nRxDB uses custom indexes in the IndexedDB RxStorage.\nRelaxed durability\nChromium based browsers allow to set durability to relaxed when creating an IndexedDB transaction. Which runs the transaction in a less secure durability mode, which can improve the performance.\n\nThe user agent may consider that the transaction has successfully committed as soon as all outstanding changes have been written to the operating system, without subsequent verification.\n\nAs shown here, using the relaxed durability mode can improve performance slightly. The best performance improvement could be measured when many small transactions have to be run. Less, bigger transaction do not benefit that much.\nExplicit transaction commits\nBy explicitly committing a transaction, another slight performance improvement can be achieved. Instead of waiting for the browser to commit an open transaction, we call the commit() method to explicitly close it.\n// .commit() is not available on all browsers, so first check if it exists.\nif (transaction.commit) {\n    transaction.commit()\n}\n\nThe improvement of this technique is minimal, but observable as these tests show.\nIn-Memory on top of IndexedDB\nTo prevent transaction handling and to fix the performance problems, we need to stop using IndexedDB as a database. Instead all data is loaded into the memory on the inital page load. Here all reads and writes happen in memory which is about 100x faster. Only some time after a write occured, the memory state is persisted into IndexedDB with a single write transaction. In this scenario IndexedDB is used as a filesystem, not as a database.\nThere are some libraries that already do that:\n\nLokiJS with the IndexedDB Adapter\nAbsurd-SQL\nSQL.js with the empscripten Filesystem API\nDuckDB Wasm\n\nIn-Memory: Persistence\nOne downsite of not directly using IndexedDB, is that your data is not persistend all the time. And when the JavaScript process exists without having persisted to IndexedDB, data can be lost. To prevent this from happening, we have to ensure that the in-memory state is written down to the disc. One point is make persisting as fast as possible. LokiJS for example has the incremental-indexeddb-adapter which only saves new writes to the disc instead of persisting the whole state. Another point is to run the persisting at the correct point in time. For example the RxDB LokiJS storage persists in the following situations:\n\nWhen the database is idle and no write or query is running. In that time we can persist the state if any new writes appeared before.\nWhen the window fires the beforeunload event we can assume that the JavaScript process is exited any moment and we have to persiste the state. After beforeunload there are several seconds time which are sufficient to store all new changes. This has shown to work quite reliable.\n\nThe only missing event that can happen is when the browser exists unexpectedly like when it crashes or when the power of the computer is shut of.\nIn-Memory: Multi Tab Support\nOne big difference between a web application and a 'normal' app, is that your users can use the app in multiple browser tabs at the same time. But when you have all database state in memory and only periodically write it to disc, multiple browser tabs could overwrite each other and you would loose data. This might not be a problem when you rely on a client-server replication, because the lost data might already be replicated with the backend and therefore with the other tabs. But this would not work when the client is offline.\nThe ideal way to solve that problem, is to use a SharedWorker. A SharedWorker is like a WebWorker that runs its own JavaScript process only that the SharedWorker is shared between multiple contexts. You could create the database in the SharedWorker and then all browser tabs could request the Worker for data instead of having their own database. But unfortunately the SharedWorker API does not work in all browsers. Safari dropped its support and InternetExplorer or Android Chrome, never addopted it. Also it cannot be polyfilled. UPDATE: Apple added SharedWorkers back in Safari 142\nInstead, we could use the BroadcastChannel API to communicate between tabs and then apply a leader election between them. The leader election ensures that, no matter how many tabs are open, always one tab is the Leader.\n\n  \n\n\nThe disadvantage is that the leader election process takes some time on the inital page load (about 150 milliseconds). Also the leader election can break when a JavaScript process is fully blocked for a longer time. When this happens, a good way is to just reload the browser tab to restart the election process.\nUsing a leader election is implemented in the RxDB LokiJS Storage.\nFurther read\n\nOffline First Database Comparison\nSpeeding up IndexedDB reads and writes\nSQLITE ON THE WEB: ABSURD-SQL\nSQLite in a PWA with FileSystemAccessAPI\nResponse to this article by Oren Eini\n\n"},"why-nosql.html":{"url":"why-nosql.html","title":"Why NoSQL","keywords":"","body":"Why it has to be NoSQL\nRxDB, a client side, offline first, JavaScript database, is now several years old.\nOften new users appear in the chat and ask for that one simple feature:\nThey want to store and query relational data.\n\nSo why not just implement SQL?\n\nAll these client databases out there have on some kind\nof document-based, NoSQL like, storage engine. PouchDB, Firebase, AWS Datastore, RethinkDB's Horizon, Meteor's Minimongo, Parse, Realm. They all do not have real relational data.\nThey might have some kind of weak relational foreign keys like the RxDB Population\nor the relational models of AWS Datastore.\nBut these relations are weak. The foreign keys are not enforced to be valid like in PostgreSQL, and you cannot query\nthe rows with complex subqueries over different tables or collections and then make mutations based on the result.\nThere must be a reason for that. In fact, there are multiple of them and in the following I want to show you why you can neither have, nor want real relational data when you have a client-side database with replication.\n\n  \n\n\n\nRelational queries in NoSQL\nWhat most people want from a relational database, is to run queries over multiple tables.\nSome people think that they cannot do that with NoSQL, so let me explain.\nLet's say you have two tables with customers and cities where each city has an id and each customer has a city_id. You want to get every customer that resides in Tokyo. With SQL, you would use a query like this:\nSELECT *\nFROM city\nWHERE city.name = 'Tokyo'\nLEFT JOIN customer ON customer.city_id = city.id;\n\nWith NoSQL you can just do the same, but you have to write it manually:\nconst cityDocument = await db.cities.findOne().where('name').equals('Tokyo').exec();\nconst customerDocuments = await db.customers.find().where('city_id').equals(cityDocument.id).exec();\n\nSo what are the differences? The SQL version would run faster on a remote database server because it would aggregate all data there and return only the customers as result set. But when you have a local database, it is not really a difference. Querying the two tables by hand would have about the same performance as a JavaScript implementation of SQL that is running locally.\nThe main benefit from using SQL is, that the SQL query runs inside of a single transaction. When a change to one of our two tables happens, while our query runs, the SQL database will ensure that the write does not affect the result of the query. This could happen with NoSQL, while you retrieve the city document, the customer table gets changed and your result is not correct for the dataset that was there when you started the querying. As a workarround, you could observe the database for changes and if a change happened in between, you have to re-run everything.\n\n  \n\n\n\nReliable replication\nIn an offline first app, your data is replicated from your backend servers to your users and you want it to be reliable.\nThe replication is reliable when, no matter what happens, every online client is able to run a replication\nand end up with the exact same database state as any other client.\nImplementing a reliable replication protocol is hard because of the circumstances of your app:\n\nYour users have unknown devices.\nThey have an unknown internet speed.\nThey can go offline or online at any time.\nClients can be offline for a several days with un-synced changes.\nYou can have many users at the same time.\nThe users can do many database writes at the same time to the same entities.\n\nNow lets say you have a SQL database and one of your users, called Alice, runs a query that mutates some rows, based on a condition.\n# mark all items out of stock as inStock=FALSE\nUPDATE\n  Table_A\nSET\n  Table_A.inStock = FALSE\nFROM\n  Table_A\nWHERE\n  Table_A.amountInStock = 0\n\nAt first, the query runs on the local database of Alice and everything is fine.\nBut at the same time Bob, the other client, updates a row and sets amountInStock from 0 to 1.\nNow Bob's client replicates the changes from Alice and runs them. Bob will end up with a different database state then Alice because on one of the rows, the WHERE condition was not met. This is not what we want, so our replication protocol should be able to fix it. For that it has to reduce all mutations into a deterministic state.\nLet me loosely describe how \"many\" SQL replications work:\nInstead of just running all replicated queries, we remember a list of all past queries. When a new query comes in that happened before our last query, we roll back the previous queries, run the new query, and then re-execute our own queries on top of that. For that to work, all queries need a timestamp so we can order them correctly. But you cannot rely on the clock that is running at the client. Client side clocks drift, they can run in a different speed or even a malicious client modifies the clock on purpose. So instead of a normal timestamp, we have to use a Hybrid Logical Clock that takes a client generated id and the number of the clients query into account. Our timestamp will then look like 2021-10-04T15:29.40.273Z-0000-eede1195b7d94dd5. These timestamps can be brought into a deterministic order and each client can run the replicated queries in the same order. Watch this video to learn how to implement that.\nWhile this sounds easy and realizable, we have some problems:\nThis kind of replication works great when you replicate between multiple SQL servers. It does not work great when you replicate between a single server and many clients.\n\nAs mentioned above, clients can be offline for a long time which could require us to do many and heavy rollbacks on each client when someone comes back after a long time and replicates the change.\nWe have many clients where many changes can appear and our database would have to roll back many times.\nDuring the rollback, the database cannot be used for read queries.\nIt is required that each client downloads and keeps the whole query history.\n\nWith NoSQL, replication works different. A new client downloads all current documents and each time a document changes, that document is downloaded again. Instead of replicating the query that leads to a data change, we just replicate the changed data itself. Of course, we could do the same with SQL and just replicate the affected rows of a query, like WatermelonDB does it. This was a clever way to go for WatermelonDB, because it was initially made for React Native and did want to use the fast SQLite instead of the slow AsyncStorage. But in a more general view, it defeats the whole purpose of having a replicating relational database because you have transactions locally, but these transactions become meaningless as soon as the data goes through the replication layer.\n\n  \n\n\n\nServer side validation\nWhenever there is client-side input, it must be validated on the server.\nOn a NoSQL database, validating a changed document is trivial. The client sends the changed document to the server, and the server can then check if the user was allowed to modify that one document and if the applied changes are ok.\nSafely validating a SQL query is up to impossible.\n\nYou first need a way to parse the query with all this complex SQL syntax and keywords.\nYou have to ensure that the query does not DOS your system.\nThen you check which rows would be affected when running the query and if the user was allowed to change them\nThen you check if the mutation to that rows are valid.\n\nFor simple queries like an insert/update/delete to a single row, this might be doable. But a query with 4 LEFT JOIN will be hard.\nEvent optimization\nWith NoSQL databases, each write event always affects exactly one document. This makes it easy to optimize the processing of events at the client. For example instead of handling multiple updates to the same document, when the user comes online again, you could skip everything but the last event.\nSimilar to that you can optimize observable query results. When you query the customers table you get a query result of 10 customers. Now a new customer is added to the table and you want to know how the new query results look like. You could analyze the event and now you know that you only have to add the new customer to the previous results set, instead of running the whole query again. These types of optimizations can be run with all NoSQL queries and even work with limit and skip operators. In RxDB this all happens in the background with the EventReduce algorithm that calculates new query results on incoming changes.\nThese optimizations do not really work with relational data. A change to one table could affect a query to any other tables. and you could not just calculate the new results based on the event. You would always have to re-run the full query to get the updated results.\nMigration without relations\nSooner or later you change the layout of your data. You update the schema and you also have to migrate the stored rows/documents. In NoSQL this is often not a big deal because all of your documents are modeled as self containing piece of data. There is an old version of the document and you have a function that transforms it into the new version.\nWith relational data, nothing is self-contained. The relevant data for the migration of a single row could be inside any other table. So when changing the schema, it will be important which table to migrate first and how to orchestrate the migration or relations.\nEverything can be downgraded to NoSQL\nTo use an offline first database in the frontend, you have to make it compatible with your backend APIs.\nMaking software things compatible often means you have to find the lowest common denominator.\nWhen you have SQLite in the frontend and want to replicate it with the backend, the backend also has to use SQLite. You cannot even use PostgreSQL because it has a different SQL dialect and some queries might fail. But you do not want to let the frontend dictate which technologies to use in the backend just to make replication work.\nWith NoSQL, you just have documents and writes to these documents. You can build a document based layer on top of everything by removing functionality. It can be built on top of SQL, but also on top of a graph database or even on top of a key-value store like levelDB.\nWith that document layer you can build a replication API that serves documents sorted by the last update time and there you have a realtime replication.\nCaching query results\nMemory is limited and this is especially true for client side applications where you never know how much free RAM the device really has. You want to have a fast realtime UI, so your database must be able to cache query results.\nWhen you run a SQL query like SELECT .. the result of it can be anything. An array, a number, a string, a single row, it depends on how the query goes on. So the caching strategy can only be to keep the result in memory, once for each query.\nThis scales very bad because the more queries you run, the more results you have to store in memory.\nWhen you make a query to a NoSQL collection, you always know how the result will look like. It is a list of documents, based on the collection's schema (if you have one). The result set is stored in memory, but because you get similar documents for different queries to the same collection, we can de-duplicated the documents. So when multiple queries return the same document, we only have it in the cache once and each query caches point to the same memory object. So no matter how many queries you make, your cache maximum is the collection size.\nTypeScript support\nModern web apps are build with TypeScript and you want the transpiler to know the types of your query result so it can give you build time errors when something does not match. This is quite easy on document based systems. The typings of for each document of a collection can be generated from the schema, and all queries to that collection will always return the given document type. With SQL you have to manually write the typings for each query by hand because it can contain all these aggregate functions that affect the type of the query's result.\n\n  \n\n\n\nWhat you lose with NoSQL\n\nYou can not run relational queries across tables inside a single transaction.\nYou can not mutate documents based on a WHERE clause, in a single transaction.\nYou need to resolve replication conflicts on a per-document basis.\n\nBut there is database XY\nYes, there are SQL databases out there that run on the client side or have replication, but not both.\n\nWebSQL / sql.js: In the past there was WebSQL in the browser. It was a direct mapping to SQLite because all browsers used the SQLite implementation. You could store relational data in it, but there was no concept of replication at any point in time. sql.js is an SQLite complied to JavaScript. It has not replication and it has (for now) no persistent storage, everything is stored in memory.\nWatermelonDB is a SQL databases that runs in the client. WatermelonDB uses a document-based replication that is not able to replicate relational queries.\nCockroach / Spanner/ PostgreSQL etc. are SQL databases with replication. But they run on servers, not on clients, so they can make different trade offs.\n\nFurther read\n\nCockroach Labs: Living Without Atomic Clocks\nMake a PR to this file if you have more interesting links to that topic\n\n"},"alternatives.html":{"url":"alternatives.html","title":"Alternatives","keywords":"","body":"Alternatives for realtime offline-first JavaScript applications\nTo give you an augmented view over the topic of client side JavaScript databases, this page contains all known alternatives to RxDB. Remember that you are reading this inside of the RxDB documentation, so everything is opinionated.\nIf you disagree with anything or think that something is missing, make a pull request to this file.\nWhat to compare with\nRxDB is an observable, replicating, offline first, JavaScript database. So it makes only sense to list similar projects as alternatives, not just any database or JavaScript store library. However, I will list up some projects that RxDB is often compared with, even if it only makes sense for some use cases.\nThis list should be seen as an entrypoint for your personal evaluation of which tool could work for your project.\n\n\nFirebase\n\n  \n\n\nFirebase is a platform developed by Google for creating mobile and web applications. Firebase has many features and products, two of which are client side databases. The Realtime Database and the Cloud Firestore.\nFirebase - Realtime Database\nThe firebase realtime database was the first database in firestore. It has to be mentioned that in this context, \"realtime\" means \"realtime replication\", not \"realtime computing\". The firebase realtime database stores data as a big unstructured JSON tree that is replicated between clients and the backend.\nFirebase - Cloud Firestore\nThe firestore is the successor to the realtime database. The big difference is that it behaves more like a 'normal' database that stores data as documents inside of collections. The conflict resolution strategy of firestore is always last-write-wins which might or might not be suitable for your use case.\nThe biggest difference to RxDB is that firebase products are only able to replicate with the firebase cloud hosted backend, which creates a vendor lock-in. RxDB can replicate with any self hosted CouchDB server or custom GraphQL endpoints.\nMeteor\n\n  \n\n\nMeteor (since 2012) is one of the oldest technologies for JavaScript realtime applications. Meteor is not a library but a whole framework with its own package manager, database management and replication protocol.\nBecause of how it works, it has proven to be hard to integrate it with other modern JavaScript frameworks like angular, vue.js or svelte.\nMeteor uses MongoDB in the backend and can replicate with a Minimongo database in the frontend.\nWhile testing, it has proven to be impossible to make a meteor app offline first capable. There are some projects that might do this, but all are unmaintained.\nMinimongo\nForked in Jan 2014 from meteorJSs' minimongo package, Minimongo is a client-side, in-memory, JavaScript version of MongoDB with backend replication over HTTP. Similar to MongoDB, it stores data in documents inside of collections and also has the same query syntax. Minimongo has different storage adapters for IndexedDB, WebSQL, LocalStorage and SQLite.\nCompared to RxDB, Minimongo has no concept of revisions or conflict handling, which might lead to undefined behavior when used with replication or in multiple browser tabs. Minimongo has no observable queries or changestream.\nWatermelonDB\n\n  \n\n\nWatermelonDB is a reactive & asynchronous JavaScript database. While originally made for React and React Native, it can also be used with other JavaScript frameworks. The main goal of WatermelonDB is performance within an application with lots of data.\nIn React Native, WatermelonDB uses the provided SQLite database. In a browser, LokiJS can be used to store and query data.\nAWS Amplify\n\n  \n\n\nAWS Amplify is a collection of tools and libraries to develope web- and mobile frontend applications. Similar to firebase, it provides everything needed like authentication, analytics, a REST API, storage and so on. Everything hosted in the AWS Cloud, even when they state that \"AWS Amplify is designed to be open and pluggable for any custom backend or service\". For realtime replication, AWS Amplify can connect to an AWS App-Sync GraphQL endpoint.\nAWS Datastore\nSince december 2019 the Amplify library includes the AWS Datastore which is a document-based, client side database that is able to replicate data via AWS AppSync in the background.\nThe main difference to other projects is the complex project configuration via the amplify cli and the bit confusing query syntax that works over functions. Complex Queries with multiple OR/AND statements are not possible which might change in the future.\nLocal development is hard because the AWS AppSync mock does not support realtime replication. It also is not really offline-first because a user login is always required.\n// An AWS datastore OR query\nconst posts = await DataStore.query(Post, c => c.or(\n  c => c.rating(\"gt\", 4).status(\"eq\", PostStatus.PUBLISHED)\n));\n\n// An AWS datastore SORT query\nconst posts = await DataStore.query(Post, Predicates.ALL, {\n  sort: s => s.rating(SortDirection.ASCENDING).title(SortDirection.DESCENDING)\n});\n\nThe biggest difference to RxDB is that you have to use the AWS cloud backends. This might not be a problem if your data is at AWS anyway.\nRethinkDB\n\n  \n\n\nRethinkDB is a backend database that pushed dynamic JSON data to the client in realtime. It was founded in 2009 and the company shut down in 2016.\nRethink db is not a client side database, it streams data from the backend to the client which of course does not work while offline.\nHorizon\nHorizon is the client side library for RethinkDB which provides useful functions like authentication, permission management and subscription to a RethinkDB backend. Offline support never made it to horizon.\nSupabase\n\n  \n\n\n\nSupabase labels itself as \"an open source Firebase alternative\". It is a collection of open source tools that together mimic many Firebase features, most of them by providing a wrapper around a PostgreSQL database. While it has realtime queries that run over the wire, like with RethinkDB, Supabase has no client-side storage or replication feature and therefore is not offline first.\nCouchDB\n\n  \n\n\nApache CouchDB is a server-side, document-oriented database that is mostly known for its multi-master replication feature. Instead of having a master-slave replication, with CouchDB you can run replication in any constellation without having a master server as bottleneck where the server even can go off- and online at any time. This comes with the drawback of having a slow replication with much network overhead.\nCouchDB has a changestream and a query syntax similar to MongoDB.\nPouchDB\n\n  \n\n\n\nPouchDB is a JavaScript database that is compatible with most of the CouchDB API. It has an adapter system that allows you to switch out the underlaying storage layer. There are many adapters like for IndexedDB, SQLite, the Filesystem and so on. The main benefit is to be able to replicate data with any CouchDB compatible endpoint.\nBecause of the CouchDB compatibility, PouchDB has to do a lot of overhead in handling the revision tree of document, which is why it can show bad performance for bigger datasets.\nRxDB was originally build around PouchDB until the storage layer was abstracted out in version 10.0.0 so it now allows to use different RxStorage implementations.\nCouchbase\nCouchbase (originally known as Membase) is another NoSQL document database made for realtime applications.\nIt uses the N1QL query language which is more SQL like compared to other NoSQL query languages. In theory you can achieve replication of a Couchbase with a PouchDB database, but this has shown to be not that easy.\nCloudant\nCloudant is a cloud-based service that is based on CouchDB and has mostly the same features.\nIt was originally designed for cloud computing where data can automatically be distributed between servers. But it can also be used to replicate with frontend PouchDB instances to create scaleable web applications.\nIt was bought by IBM in 2014 and since 2018 the Cloudant Shared Plan is retired and migrated to IBM Cloud.\nHoodie\nHoodie is a backend solution that enables offline-first JavaScript frontend development without having to write backend code. Its main goal is to abstract away configuration into simple calls to the Hoodie API.\nIt uses CouchDB in the backend and PouchDB in the frontend to enable offline-first capabilities.\nThe last commit for hoodie was one year ago and the website (hood.ie) is offline which indicates it is not an active project anymore.\nLokiJS\nLokiJS is a JavaScript embeddable, in-memory database. And because everything is handled in-memory, LokiJS has awesome performance when mutating or querying data. You can still persist to a permanent storage (IndexedDB, Filesystem etc.) with one of the provided storage adapters. The persistence happens after a timeout is reached after a write, or before the JavaScript process exits. This also means you could loose data when the JavaScript process exits ungracefully like when the power of the device is shut down or the browser crashes.\nWhile the project is not that active anymore, it is more finished then unmaintained.\nRxDB supports using LokiJS as RxStorage.\nGundb\nGUN is a JavaScript graph database. While having many features, the decentralized replication is the main unique selling point. You can replicate data Peer-to-Peer without any centralized backend server. GUN has several other features that are useful on top of that, like encryption and authentication.\nWhile testing it was really hard to get basic things running. GUN is open source, but because of how the source code is written, it is very difficult to understand what is going wrong.\nsql.js\nsql.js is a javascript library to run SQLite on the web. It uses a virtual database file stored in memory and does not have any persistence. All data is lost once the JavaScript process exits. sql.js is created by compiling SQLite to WebAssembly so it has about the same features as SQLite. For older browsers there is a JavaScript fallback.\nabsurd-sQL\nAbsurd-sql is a project that implements an IndexedDB-based persistence for sql.js. Instead of directly writing data into the IndexedDB, it treats IndexedDB like a disk and stores data in blocks there which shows to have a much better performance, mostly because of how performance expensive IndexedDB transactions are.\nNeDB\nNeDB was a embedded persistent or in-memory database for Node.js, nw.js, Electron and browsers.\nIt is document-oriented and had the same query syntax as MongoDB. \nLike LokiJS it has persistence adapters for IndexedDB etc. to persist the database state on the disc.\nThe last commit to NeDB was in 2016.\nDexie.js\nDexie.js is a minimalistic wrapper for IndexedDB. While providing a better API then plain IndexedDB, Dexie also improves performance by batching transactions and other optimizations. It also ads additional non-IndexedDB features like observable queries or multi tab support or react hooks.\nCompared to RxDB, Dexie.js does not support complex (MongoDB-like) queries and requires a lot of fiddling when a document range of a specific index must be fetched.\nDexie.js is used by Whatsapp Web, Microsoft To Do and Github Desktop.\nRxDB supports using Dexie.js as RxStorage which enhances IndexedDB with RxDB features like MongoDB-like queries etc.\nMongoDB Realm\nOriginally Realm was a mobile database for Android and iOS. Later they added support for other languages and runtimes, also for JavaScript. \nIt was meant as replacement for SQLite but is more like an object store then a full SQL database.\nIn 2019 MongoDB bought Realm and changed the projects focus.\nNow Realm is made for replication with the MongoDB Realm Sync based on the MongoDB Atlas Cloud platform.\nApollo\nThe Apollo GraphQL platform is made to transfer data between a server to UI applications over GraphQL endpoints. It contains several tools like GraphQL clients in different languages or libraries to create GraphQL endpoints.\nWhile it is has different caching features for offline usage, compared to RxDB it is not fully offline first because caching alone does not mean your application is fully useable when the user is offline.\nRead further\n\nOffline First Database Comparison\nhttps://jaredforsyth.com/tags/local-first/\n\n"},"questions-answers.html":{"url":"questions-answers.html","title":"Questions & Answers","keywords":"","body":"Questions and answers\nCan't change the schema\nWhen you make changes to the schema of a collection, you sometimes can get an error like\nError: addCollections(): another instance created this collection with a different schema.\nThis means you have created a collection before and added document-data to it.\nWhen you now just change the schema, it is likely that the new schema does not match the saved documents inside of the collection.\nThis would cause strange bugs and would be hard to debug, so RxDB check's if your schema has changed and throws an error.\nTo change the schema in production-mode, do the following\n\nIncrease the version by 1\nAdd the appropriate migrationStrategies so the saved data will be modified to match the new schema\n\nIn development-mode, the schema-change can be simplified by one of these strategies:\n\nUse the memory-adapter so your db resets on restart and your schema is not safed permanently\nCall removeRxDatabase('mydatabasename', 'adapter'); before creating a new RxDatabase-instance\nAdd a timestamp as suffix to the database-name to create a new one each run like name: 'heroesDB' + new Date().getTime()\n\n"},"contribute.html":{"url":"contribute.html","title":"Contribute","keywords":"","body":"Contribution\nWe are open to, and grateful for, any contributions made by the community.\nDeveloping\nRequirements\nBefore you can start developing, do the following:\n\nMake sure you have installed nodejs with version 7 or higher\nClone the repository git clone https://github.com/pubkey/rxdb.git\nInstall the dependencies cd rxdb && npm install\nMake sure that the tests work for you npm run test\n\nFlow\nWhile developing you should run npm run dev and leave it open in the console.
